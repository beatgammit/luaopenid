1. Introduction

This project provides a Lua implementation of the OpenID (http://openid.net/)
authentication protocol.

Currently only an OpenID server implementation has been completed. The server
implementation includes all required components of the spec, but does not yet
support the optional Diffie-Hellman secret key exchange.

2. Requirements

  - Lua 5.1 - http://www.lua.org/
  
    Lua OpenID requires Lua 5.1 (beta) since it uses the new Lua package
    system. It would probably work with Compat-5.1 as well with some minor
    tweaking.

  - luacrypto 0.1.0 - http://luacrypto.luaforge.net/
    
    Lua OpenID uses luacrypto for all of its cryptographic requirements.

  - LuaSocket - http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~diego/professional/luasocket/
    
    Lua OpenID uses LuaSocket for its HTTP requests and URL parsing. You will
    probably want to remove the Compat-5.1 layer (easy to do) if you run this
    under Lua 5.1 (beta).

3. Installation

This is a manual process. Simply copy the lua libraries under src (preserving
the directory hierarchy from there) to wherever you keep your Lua addons.

4. Credits

The implementation details of certain features, particularly the assoc
handles, was drawn from the Perl implementation (http://search.cpan.org/
~bradfitz/Net-OpenID-Server-0.10/lib/Net/OpenID/Server.pm) by Brad
Fitzpatrick. CGI parameter handling is done using a modified version of Jared
Jennings' cgi5.lua (http://dingoskidneys.com/~jaredj/#lua).
